.SS Details
.P
\fBnpm access\fP always operates directly on the current registry, configurable
from the command line using \fB\-\-registry=<registry url>\fP\|\.
.P
Unscoped packages are \fIalways public\fR\|\.
.P
Scoped packages \fIdefault to restricted\fR, but you can either publish them as
public using \fBnpm publish \-\-access=public\fP, or set their access as public using
\fBnpm access public\fP after the initial publish\.
.P
You must have privileges to set the access of a package:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
You are an owner of an unscoped or scoped package\.
.IP \(bu 2
You are a member of the team that owns a scope\.
.IP \(bu 2
You have been given read\-write privileges for a package, either as a member
of a team or directly as an owner\.

.RE
.P
If you have two\-factor authentication enabled then you'll be prompted to
provide an otp token, or may use the \fB\-\-otp=\.\.\.\fP option to specify it on
the command line\.
.P
If your account is not paid, then attempts to publish scoped packages will
fail with an HTTP 402 status code (logically enough), unless you use
\fB\-\-access=public\fP\|\.
.P
Management of teams and team memberships is done with the \fBnpm team\fP command\.
